Finally the moment has come to say goodbye, which is never easy, especially to place where everyone is soo supportive and which gives ample of opportunities to enhance our technical and professional skills.

I feel extremely privileged having got the opportunity to know and work with so many talented individuals in FOS (Print & Mail) who are so welcoming and friendly. It has truly been an ‘enriching life experience’ for me !!

I would like to thank my supervisor Satnam Singh for his guidance and support from day one. I will never forget the day when i joined the FIS and on very first day I shared my confusion with him and he gave me his precious advice then based on that i took the decision. I really like the way he manage the things in projects and his cool way of working. It was a wonderful journey working under his supervision and words are not enough to express those moments and will always remember as my awe-inspiring compagno.

Sincere thanks to all of you for your support and guidance. I am also very thankful to QA Team who were always there to guide me throughout the journey. And a very Big "Thank You" to all my dearest friends with whom I have spent the wonderful moments, that would last a lifetime.

Even though I will miss you all, I am looking forward to the new challenges and to start a new phase in my career. I wish you all the very best in life.

And Finally this is not a goodbye, only "see you later".

I am reachable at my personal email mcaparshant@gmail.com and contact number 9154159698.
 
It was a pleasure knowing each and every one of you. Please stay in touch.

Thanks,
Parshant Gupta
